Accretion discs primarily form around compact objects, such as black holes or young stellar objects (YSOs), 
during the process of accretion. These discs result from the infall of matter onto the central object due to gravitational forces. 
On the other hand, protoplanetary discs form around young stars as a byproduct of the star formation process.


Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used to simulate fluid dynamics and other physical phenomena. 
It represents a fluid or a continuous medium as a collection of discrete particles, 
where each particle carries certain properties such as mass, position, velocity, and other attributes.


For the SPH simulation, we represent the fluid as a collection of particles. 
Each particle has an initial position, velocity and mass, with both position and velocity being vectors.

# KERNAL FUNCTION

'''

In SPH, a smoothing function, known as the kernel function, is used to distribute the mass of each particle in space. 
The purpose of the kernel function is to define the influence of a particle on its neighboring particles.
It determines how the properties of a particle, such as density or pressure, affect nearby particles within a specified radius.
The kernel function assigns a weight or contribution to each neighboring particle based on their spatial proximity.


When calculating properties like density or pressure for a particle, the kernel function is applied 
to all neighboring particles within the defined radius.
The contribution of each neighboring particle is weighted based on its distance from the particle of interest.
The closer particles have a higher contribution, while particles farther away have a lesser influence.

The Kernel Function is derived from the Dirac function.
There are many smoothing kernels, like the Gaussian Kernel, Cubic spline Kernel,
Quintic Kernel, etc.

We make use of the Gaussian Kernel.
Gaussian Kernel is a kernel with the shape of a Gaussian (normal distribution) curve.

A Gaussian kernel is a mathematical function that is used to calculate the similarity or weight between points in a dataset. 
It is commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks such as smoothing, blurring, and feature extraction.

The Gaussian kernel is based on the Gaussian distribution, also known as the bell curve. 
It has a characteristic shape with a peak at the center and gradually decreases towards the edges. 
The kernel assigns higher weights to points that are closer to the center and lower weights to points that are farther away.

'''
Here's an explanation of each step:

1. imgs_list = glob.glob('output/*.png'): 

The 'glob' module is imported, and the 'glob.glob()' function is used to search for files with the extension .png in the output directory. 
The resulting list of file paths is assigned to the 'imgs_list' variable

2. lsorted = sorted(imgs_list, key=lambda x: int(os.path.splitext(x[7:])[0])): 

'The sorted()' function is used to sort the 'imgs_list' in ascending order based on the numeric portion of the file names. 
This is achieved by providing a key function that extracts the numeric part from each file name using 'os.path.splitext()' to split 
the file name and extension, and then converting it to an integer. The sorted list is assigned to the 'lsorted' variable.

3. for 'filename' in tqdm.tqdm(lsorted): : 

A loop is initiated that iterates over each file name in the sorted list 'lsorted'. The 'tqdm.tqdm()' function is used to wrap 'lsorted', 
providing a progress bar for the loop.

4. img = cv2.imread(filename): 

For each iteration of the loop, the 'cv2.imread()' function from the OpenCV (cv2) module is used to read the image data 
from the file specified by filename. The resulting image is assigned to the img variable.

5. height, width, layers = img.shape: 

The shape 'attribute' of the img array is accessed to retrieve the height, width, and number of color channels (layers) of the image. 
These values are assigned to the height, width, and layers variables, respectively.

6. size = (width,height): 

The width and height values are used to create a tuple size representing the dimensions of the image.

7. img_array.append(img): 

The 'img array', representing the image data read from the file, is appended to the 'img_array' list.

The code reads a list of image file paths matching a specific pattern using the glob module, sorts them based on the 
numeric part of the file names, and then iterates over the sorted list. For each file, it reads the image data using OpenCV, 
extracts the image dimensions, and appends the image data to the img_array list. The tqdm module is used to provide a progress bar 
for the loop, showing the progress of reading and processing the images.

The 'cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()' function is used to convert the 'FourCC' code to the required format.

This parameter specifies the frames per second (fps) of the output video. In this case, the video will have a frame rate of 60 frames
